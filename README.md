In this Project we use data from a large bank and our main goal is to produce insights for the bank through the data analysis.

Under `Data-Analysis/` we store the notebooks in which we perform the following tasks:

* Firstly, we make some data exploration through data visualization. Then, we clean the

data and perform the adequate feauture engineering. Following, we build a machine learning

model in order to predict if a client will have a paid subscription-based plan or a standard 

plan.
